## What Should Happen

**Turn 1-3:** Bot asks contextual follow-ups about work/peace/stress

**Turn 4:** Bot transitions to WISDOM ✅ and provides:
- Acknowledgment of overwork stress
- Dharmic verse about karma yoga or work-life balance
- Practical action (meditation, break-taking, breathing)
- Warm closing

**NOT:** Asking "Tell me more about overwork?" ❌

---

## Key Indicators

✅ Bot mentions "overwork" or "work stress" in understanding
✅ Bot mentions emotion: "stress" or "overwhelm"
✅ Bot provides actual dharmic guidance (not a question)
✅ Bot includes a verse
✅ Response feels empathic and wise, not questioning

---

## If This Works

The core issues are fixed:
1. Emotion inference from context working
2. Readiness transition at turn 3+ working
3. Wisdom phase delivering guidance (not questions)

You can now test other emotions and scenarios!
